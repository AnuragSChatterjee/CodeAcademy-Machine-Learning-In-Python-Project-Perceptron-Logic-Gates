# CodeAcademy-Machine-Learning-In-Python-Project-Perceptron-Logic-Gates
In this project, I used perceptrons and neural networks analysis to model the fundamental building blocks of computers i.e logic gates which are pivotal components in electrical circuit/eletronics design which is my field of study!
